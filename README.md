# Project for Introduction to Data Science, University of Tartu 2023

Author: Erko Olumets

Project uses data from the English Premier League (EPL) seasons 19/20 to 22/23 first ten gameweeks, to predict match outcomes of season 22/23 gameweeks 11-38.
These probabilities are taken and compared to historical betting data odds from 22/23 season to see if the model would be profitable.

Data used from Stathead FBref and football-data.co.uk/
